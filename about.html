         <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
         <p>Dayo Dada</p>
      </div>
      <div class="story-body">
         <p>Dahrey Agric Empire sprouted from humble beginnings, rooted in passion and necessity. As a graduate of
            Olabisi Onabanjo University College of Agriculture, I faced the daunting reality of unemployment. Determined
            to carve my own path, I turned to agriculture—an industry I deeply cherished and believed in. With a desire
            to make a difference and a family legacy to uphold, I seized the opportunity to delve into
            agriculture as it is my family business. What started as a simple venture soon blossomed into Dahrey Agric
            Empire, driven by a shared passion<span class="elipsis">...</span> <span class="details hide">

               for nurturing the land and reaping its
               bountiful rewards.
               Today, agriculture isn't just a business for us—it's a calling. It's our purpose, our livelihood, and our
               commitment to sustainable growth. From those initial seeds of determination, we've cultivated a thriving
               empire, grounded in the values of hard work, innovation, and a profound love for the land.
            </span>
         </p>
         <p class="details hide">
            The journey of Dahrey Agric Empire was a rugged yet rewarding odyssey, which started in the year 2014. It
            was characterised by perseverance and resilience. In the early days, we faced countless challenges—financial
            constraints, unpredictable weather, untrusted workers and the steep learning curve of agricultural
            entrepreneurship.

         </p>
         <p class="details hide">
            Patience became our steadfast companion as we nurtured our crops and tended to our animals, knowing that
            true growth takes time. While agriculture demanded our undivided attention and energy, we recognized the
            need for additional sources of income to sustain our venture.
         </p>
         <p class="details hide">With determination as our guide, we diversified our endeavors, exploring complementary
            avenues to supplement
            our agricultural pursuits. We embraced versatility as a means of weathering the storms and fueling our
            agricultural aspirations.

         </p>
         <p class="details hide">Each setback became an opportunity for innovation, each obstacle a lesson in
            resilience. We learned to
            adapt, to pivot, and to persevere in the face of adversity. And as our efforts began to bear fruit—literally
            and figuratively—we witnessed the gradual but undeniable growth of Dahrey Agric Empire.</p>
         <p class="details hide">Today, as we reflect on our journey, we're reminded that success in agriculture is not
            just about reaping
            profits—it's about cultivating patience, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to the land. Our story
            serves as a testament to the power of perseverance and the transformative potential of passion-driven
            pursuits. And as we continue to sow the seeds of our dreams, we do so with gratitude for the challenges that
            shaped us and the opportunities that lie ahead.
